## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The monitoring infrastructure consists of:

```
Monitoring Stack
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dependency Monitor       # Multi-language dependency scanning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Prometheus              # Metrics collection and storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Grafana                 # Visualization and dashboards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AlertManager            # Alert routing and management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Service Discovery       # Automatic service detection
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Deploy Local Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k /Users/pwner/Git/ABS/solidity-security-monitoring/k8s/overlays/local/
   ```

2. **Access Dashboards**:
   - Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
   - Dependency Monitor API: `http://localhost:8080`

3. **Verify Health**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
   ```

## üìà Key Metrics

### Dependency Health
- `dependency_current_version_info` - Current package versions
- `dependency_security_vulnerabilities_total` - Security vulnerabilities by severity
- `service_dependency_count_total` - Total dependencies per service

### Service Performance
- `dependency_scan_duration_seconds` - Scan execution time
- `dependency_scan_errors_total` - Scan failure tracking
- `service_vulnerabilities_total` - Total vulnerabilities per service

### Operational Metrics
- `up` - Service availability
- `process_cpu_seconds_total` - CPU usage
- `process_resident_memory_bytes` - Memory usage

## üîß Configuration

### Environment-Specific Settings

#### Local Development
- Minimal resource allocation
- Basic monitoring features
- Single-node deployment

#### Staging
- Full feature set
- Moderate resource allocation
- Production-like configuration

#### Production
- High availability setup
- Auto-scaling enabled
- Enhanced security policies

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

### Access Control
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for all monitoring components
- **Network Policies**: Restricted network access between components
- **TLS**: Encrypted communication for all external connections

### Data Protection
- **Read-Only Access**: Repository scanning with read-only permissions
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of credentials and API keys
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all operations

## üìã Best Practices

### Monitoring
1. Set up baseline metrics for all services
2. Configure appropriate alert thresholds
3. Regular dashboard maintenance and updates
4. Balance monitoring coverage with alert noise

### Dependency Management
1. Prioritize security updates over feature updates
2. Test dependency updates in isolation
3. Maintain documentation for breaking changes
4. Schedule regular dependency review cycles

### Operations
1. Keep runbooks updated with current procedures
2. Regular team training on monitoring tools
3. Automate routine monitoring tasks
4. Continuous improvement through metrics review
